# Angular-D3 Social Graph

This project presents the end-product of a process using skills in Python, throttled/paginated API calls, Typescript, and D3 visualization on an Angular platform. See the live visualization [here](https://nostava.com/angular-d3/).

* Imported data from the [Twitter API] (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api") using [Python, Tweepy] (https://www.tweepy.org/").
* Cleaned and structured data using [Python, Pandas] (https://pandas.pydata.org/).
* Created visualization using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) (inspired by [this project](https://observablehq.com/@d3/mobile-patent-suits)).
* Added several customizations and enhancements.
* Converted to [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and built on the [Angular](https://angular.io/) platform.
